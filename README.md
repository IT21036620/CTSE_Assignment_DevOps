# CTSE Assignment DevOps Project

## Overview
This repository contains the DevOps project for the CTSE module. The project focuses on the implementation of CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions to automate the build, test, and deployment processes of a microservice. The microservice is containerized using Docker and deployed on Azure Container Apps to ensure consistent deployment across different environments.

  - Automated CI/CD pipelines streamline development and deployment processes.
  - Containerization supports consistent deployments across various environments.
  - Integrated security measures protect and manage access to the microservice.
  - Comprehensive testing and deployment feedback through automated workflows.

## Technologies Used
- **GitHub Actions**: Automates CI/CD workflows within the GitHub repository.
- **Docker**: Utilized for containerizing the microservice and its dependencies.
- **Azure Container Apps**: Manages and scales the containerized microservice deployment.
- **Keycloak**: Provides security measures and handles data securely.
- **SonarCloud**: Used for static source code analysis to maintain code quality.
